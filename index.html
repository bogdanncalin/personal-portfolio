                    During <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com'>TheOdinProject</a> course, I had the opportunity to work on an Etch-a-Sketch project, 
                    which involved creating an interactive application that allowed the user to create drawings on the screen using the mouse. 
                    I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the application, and learned a lot about the interaction between these technologies in the 
                    web development process. I used CSS to create the graphical interface of the application.
                    I used JavaScript to define the programming logic of the application, as well as to create functions that allowed users 
                    to change the color of the drawing pen, make it random, change the size of the board or erase the drawings created. In the project, I took an 
                    iterative approach and performed tests to ensure the quality of the code and functionalities. By successfully completing this project, I 
                    gained more experience in developing interactive web application and improved my programming skills</div>

                    which involved creating a simple and interactive game that allowed users to play against the computer.

                    programming in JavaScript. CSS was used to create the game's graphical interface, as well as to define the appearance and 
                    style of the selection buttons. JavaScript was used to define the game's programming logic, such as randomly choosing the computer's moves, 
                    comparing the user's and computer's moves, and displaying the final result. I also implemented a scoring system to track the game's score
                     during gameplay. </div>

                        While studying at the Faculty of Automatics and Computer Science I had the opportunity to dive deep into the field of computer science and 
                        learn about various aspects of automation and control systems. I was able to expand my knowledge of computer architecture, 
                        operating systems, databases, programming languages, and software engineering.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition to gaining technical knowledge, I also developed important soft skills such as teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving. 
                        I collaborated with peers on group projects and participated in discussions and presentations.

                        During my time at I.C. Vissarion High School, I was enrolled in a mathematics-informatics intensive curriculum. This rigorous academic program provided me with a strong foundation in both mathematics and computer science, as well as the practical skills needed to succeed in these fields. I was exposed to a wide range of topics, including algebra, geometry, calculus, programming, and data structures, among others.

<br><br>Throughout my studies, I was challenged to think critically, solve complex problems, and develop creative solutions to real-world challenges. I was also given the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and assignments, ranging from coding projects to mathematical proofs.
<br> <br>
I.C. Vissarion High School provided me with a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment that helped me grow both academically and personally. The skills and knowledge I gained during my time there continue to serve me well in my career today, as I pursue my passion for mathematics and computer science.

                        I had the opportunity to work on a variety of initiatives that aimed to address pressing global issues, including mental health, global warming, ecology, and zero waste. As a participant in these projects, I collaborated with other young people from across Europe and beyond, sharing ideas, insights, and perspectives on these important topics. Through interactive workshops, team-building activities, and engaging discussions, I gained a deeper understanding of the challenges facing our planet and the ways in which we can work together to create positive change.

One of the most rewarding aspects of these projects was the opportunity to develop my leadership and teamwork skills.
                    <br><br> As a participant, I was able to take on various roles and responsibilities, such as organizing workshops, leading group discussions, and facilitating team-building exercises. Through these experiences, I gained a greater sense of self-confidence and developed valuable skills that I have been able to apply in other areas of my life. Overall, my time participating in Erasmus+ youth projects was a transformative experience that broadened my horizons, expanded my network of contacts, and deepened my commitment to making a positive impact in the world.

                        During my time volunteering for LSAC, I was part of the Logistics department, which played a vital role in organizing student events 
                        by handling the logistical aspects of the events. This involved managing cables, wiring, and networks, among other things, to ensure 
                        that everything was in place and working smoothly for the attendees. As part of the department, I was responsible for working closely 
                        with other volunteers to ensure that everything was set up correctly and on time. 
                        <br><br>I gained valuable experience in event logistics, 
                        including problem-solving and teamwork, and had the opportunity to contribute to the success of several successful events. 
                        Additionally, I was proud to be part of an association that cared about the well-being of students and helped foster a sense of 
                        community within the university.

                        As a coordinator in Proedus summer camps, I was responsible for a group of 10-12 high school students who were attending the camp. My duties included ensuring their safety, organizing and supervising their daily activities, and addressing any issues or concerns they may have had. I was responsible for creating a schedule for the group and making sure they followed it, as well as planning and executing various outdoor and indoor activities for them.
                        <br><br>
Additionally, I was in charge of monitoring their behavior and enforcing camp rules, while also serving as a mentor and providing guidance to the students when necessary. This required me to be highly organized, attentive, and patient, as well as possess strong communication skills. Through this experience, I developed leadership skills, learned how to manage a group of individuals with varying needs and personalities, and gained valuable experience in working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment.
